- My responsibility as an intern was to help WeHear develop an iOS application which will work fluently with WeHear Bone Conduction based earphones. 
- The main focus of the app was to act as a dashboard for the earphones, where we can control various features of the earphones like hearing-aid mode, checking sound level, etc
