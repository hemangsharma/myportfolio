This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate the fundamental steps of image preprocessing and feature extraction. These processes are essential for preparing images as input for machine learning models. Each notebook walks through a series of techniques to transform and analyze images, using Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Below is an outline of each notebookâ€™s purpose and key steps.
