This Jupyter Notebook generates and visualizes a hops graph based on user input. The hops graph starts from a single node 'A' and extends to multiple nodes based on the number of hops specified by the user. It uses NetworkX and Plotly libraries for graph generation and visualization, providing an interactive and detailed representation of the hops graph.
