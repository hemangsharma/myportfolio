Visual Question Answering (VQA) for medical images is an advanced task in the field of medical imaging and artificial intelligence. This project aims to bridge the gap between image recognition and medical knowledge, enabling machines to comprehend and interpret the content of medical images (such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) and subsequently answer questions posed in natural language based on that content. The goal is to develop a VQA system specifically designed for medical images to aid healthcare professionals in medical diagnosis and patient care.
