This project aims to develop an accurate prediction model to guide property investment decisions in Australia. By leveraging comprehensive real estate data, the model will provide insights into market trends, regional preferences, and property valuation. The ultimate goal is to help stakeholders make informed investment choices by understanding the factors that drive property prices and demand.
