This project solves several problems and reduces reliance on manual work and paperwork in the following ways:

- Residents can easily access the rules online at any time, ensuring they are always aware of the guidelines.
- Reduces the need for printed materials, saving paper and contributing to environmental sustainability.
- Streamlines the onboarding process by providing new residents with immediate access to the rules, reducing the need for physical handouts and meetings.
