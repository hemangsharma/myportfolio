This project predicts customer's lifetime value (CLV) using a data provided by MLAA bank. By predicting CLV through transactional histories, a forecast into the customer's lifetime value to Bank MLAA may be understood. From a business perspective, the objective is to recognise customers which frequently demonstrate high value and formulate marketing strategies to enhance customer retention to ultimately increase profitability. Predicting CLV offers Bank MLAA the capacity to allocate resources and customise personalised offers to optimise customer satisfaction and loyalty.
