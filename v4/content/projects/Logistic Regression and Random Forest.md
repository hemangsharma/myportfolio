This project analysis a marketing campaign's success using customer data. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were built, with the Random Forest model performing better. Feature importance identified crucial attributes, helping target campaigns. Responsiveness analysis by month revealed optimal and low-responsive periods. The 'account_balance' feature categorised customers' account balances and showed that those with 'high' balances were most responsive. The report provides actionable insights to enhance campaign effectiveness.
